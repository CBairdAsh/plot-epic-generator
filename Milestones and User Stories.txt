Milestone 1: Plot Procedural Generator
Objective: Create an algorithm that generates basic plot structures (beginning, conflict, resolution) with variables for characters, settings, and key events.
User Stories:
- As a GM, I want to generate a plot outline so that I can quickly create a campaign setting.
- As a solo player, I want to receive a plot that adjusts based on my character's actions and choices.
- As a writer, I want to generate a plot based on Lester Dent's Plot formula

Objective: Develop a system for generating dynamic NPCs with personalities, motivations, and backgrounds. This could also be used by writers for character creation.
User Stories:
- As a GM, I want to quickly create NPCs to populate my world without having to detail every aspect from scratch.
- As a player, I want NPCs in my solo campaign to have depth and react logically to my actions.
- As a writer, I want to generate a NPCs/Characters that would fit with a Lester Dent Plot formula.

Milestone 3: Encounter Procedural Generator

User Stories:
- As a solo player, I want a system that can act as a GM, providing narrative guidance, making adjudications, and keeping the story moving.
